I" <p>This is going to be a weirly long post. I recently did a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-do-the-30-day-song-challenge-on-instagram-22774509">30-day music challenge</a> on my <a href="https://facebook.com/calebaren">Facebook</a>/<a href="https://instagram.com/calebaren">Instagram</a> stories. Iâ€™ve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>
