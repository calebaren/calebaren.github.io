I"m<p>It is readily apparent that Schubert possessed a special partiality toward Beethoven. Schubert had dedicated an earlier set of variations (Op. 10, D. 624) to Beethoven and Schubert professed a lifelong admiration of his older contemporary. But Beethoven’s influence on Schubert extends beyond a simple dedication: Schubert’s borrowing of material and various allusions to Beethoven’s works are apparent in many of his own lieder and chamber music. The three works that I will most closely analyze are the B-flat Piano Sonata, D. 960, “Auf dem Strom”, D. 943, and “Der Atlas” from Schwanengesang. In each of these three works, a common thread of reverence and remembrance of Beethoven runs, either explicitly or more obliquely. Schubert adapts the original context of Beethovenian melodies into something more suitable for Schubert’s own musical purpose.</p>
