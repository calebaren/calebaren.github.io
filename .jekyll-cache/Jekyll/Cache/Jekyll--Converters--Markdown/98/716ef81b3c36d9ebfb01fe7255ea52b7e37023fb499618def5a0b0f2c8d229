I""<p>This is going to be a short post. I recently did a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-do-the-30-day-song-challenge-on-instagram-22774509">30-day music challenge</a> on my <a href="https://facebook.com/calebaren">Facebook</a>/<a href="https://instagram.com/calebaren">Instagram</a> stories. I’ve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 32, since I included a couple of extra pieces some days) pieces that I featured below:</p>

<h3 id="a-song-you-like-with-a-color-in-the-title">A song you like with a color in the title</h3>
<p>Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin</p>
<h3 id="a-song-you-like-with-a-number-in-the-title">A song you like with a number in the title</h3>
<p>Trois beaux oiseaux du paradis (“Three birds of paradise”), Maurice Ravel</p>
<h3 id="a-song-that-reminds-you-of-summertime">A song that reminds you of summertime</h3>
<p>Knoxville: Summer of 1915, Samuel Barber</p>
<ul>
  <li>A song that reminds you of someone you’d rather forget: Serenade for string orchestra, Op.9, Josef Suk</li>
  <li>A song that needs to be played loud: La Valse, Maurice Ravel</li>
</ul>
