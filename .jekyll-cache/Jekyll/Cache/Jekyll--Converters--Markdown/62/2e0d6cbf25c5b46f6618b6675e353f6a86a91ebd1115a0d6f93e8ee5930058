I"⁄<p>This is going to be a short post. I recently did a 30-day music challenge on my Facebook/Instagram stories. I‚Äôve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 32, since I included a couple of extra pieces some days) pieces that I featured below. I may do more in-depth essays on a couple of these later.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs a lot of Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Ravel. I wholly expected there to be more Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Mozart but the evocative prompts like ‚ÄúA song that reminds you of summer‚Äù, ‚ÄúA song about drugs or alcohol‚Äù made big, brassy Romantic compositions an easy target.</p>
