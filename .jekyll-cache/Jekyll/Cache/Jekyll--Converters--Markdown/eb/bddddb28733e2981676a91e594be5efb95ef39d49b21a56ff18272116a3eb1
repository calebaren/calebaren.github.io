I"E<p>This is going to be a short post. I recently did a 30-day music challenge on my Facebook/Instagram stories. I’ve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 32, since I included a couple of extra pieces some days) pieces that I featured below:</p>

<p>A song you like with a color in the title
Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin</p>

<p>A song you like with a number in the title
Trois beaux oiseaux du paradis (“Three birds of paradise”), Maurice Ravel</p>

<p>A song that reminds you of summertime</p>
