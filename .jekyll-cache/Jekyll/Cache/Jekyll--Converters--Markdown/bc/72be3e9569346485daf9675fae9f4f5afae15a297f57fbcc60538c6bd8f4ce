I"Ω<p>This is going to be a short post. I recently did a 30-day music challenge on my Facebook/Instagram stories. I‚Äôve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 32, since I included a couple of extra pieces some days) pieces that I featured below:</p>

<p>A song you like with a color in the title
Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin
A song you like with a number in the title
Trois beaux oiseaux du paradis (‚ÄúThree birds of paradise‚Äù), Maurice Ravel
A song that reminds you of summertime
Knoxville: Summer of 1915, Samuel Barber</p>

<p>A song that reminds you of someone you‚Äôd rather forget: Serenade for string orchestra, Op.9, Josef Suk
  A song that needs to be played loud: La Valse, Maurice Ravel</p>
