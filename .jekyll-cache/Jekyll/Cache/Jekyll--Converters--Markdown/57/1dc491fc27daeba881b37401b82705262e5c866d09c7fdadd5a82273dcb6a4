I"¤<p>Schubertâ€™s use of the piano in his lieder extends beyond simple harmonic support. Schubert employs several techniques in the instrumental accompaniment that supports the vivid imagery of the text and follows closely the dramatic leanings and urges that the singer undergoes, using several distinctive textures and instrumental effects even within the span of a single song to add depth and emotional support to the singer. I will examine two songsâ€”<em>Erlkonig</em> and <em>Gretchen am Spinnerade</em>â€”that offer exemplary instances of Schubertâ€™s vivid word painting, scene-setting through instrumental passages, and contrast through his use of the piano part.</p>
