I"E<p>The wide, unending sea captured classical imaginations: from the heroic undertakings of Jason and the Argonauts to the voyages of Odysseus. In each of those instances, the sea was personified by the powerful god Poseidon , who more often than not directly interfered in the journey of the heroes. However, Sophocles develops the relationship between the sea and Oedipus on a metaphorical rather than literal and supernatural level. Oedipus Rex takes place entirely over land, and yet the image of the sea often appears in unexpected locations as a symbol of darkness, of destiny, or even of the unholy coupling of Jocasta and Oedipus. In this regard, Sophocles’ distinct lack of godly interference in Oedipus stands in stark contrast to the earlier and supernatural epics of Homer and Hesiod. As noticed by Bernard Knox in his introduction to the play, “there is not one supernatural event in it, no gods, no monsters…. it is the most relentlessly secular of the Sophoclean tragedies” (Knox 134). Yet Sophocles does not present a worldview in which humans rule supreme over their respective destinies; instead, the role of the gods as fatal arbiters has been supplanted by a formless, general sense of inevitability itself, represented as a series of evolving nautical metaphors that eventually signal Oedipus’ subjugation to fate.</p>
