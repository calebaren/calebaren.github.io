I"ù<p>This is going to be a weirly long post. I recently did a 30-day music challenge on my Facebook/Instagram stories. I‚Äôve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 31, since I included an extra piece on day 8) pieces that I featured below. I may do more in-depth essays on a couple of these later.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs a lot of Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Ravel. I wholly expected there to be more Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Mozart but the evocative prompts like ‚ÄúA song that reminds you of summer‚Äù, ‚ÄúA song about drugs or alcohol‚Äù made big, brassy Romantic compositions an easy target.</p>

<p>For your listening convenience I‚Äôve included a Spotify playlist of all the pieces I‚Äôve featured near the footer. For multi-movement pieces (symphonies, chamber music, etc.) I‚Äôve included the entire work although I only chose to highlighted certain movements in my 30-day challenge.</p>

<p>Pieces that are not nominally multi-movement but consist of collections of pieces (Trois chansons, Klavierst√ºcke, etc.), I‚Äôve split the difference and included a subset (up to the full collection) that I think make the most sense and would be reasonable to enjoy as a single artistic statement.</p>

<p>Without further ado:</p>
