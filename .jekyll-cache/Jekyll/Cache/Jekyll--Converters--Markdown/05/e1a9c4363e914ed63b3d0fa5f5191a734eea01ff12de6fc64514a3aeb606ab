I"	<p>About a year and change ago, I was in the market for a camera. The only photography I had done up until that point was on my trusty iPhone 6s from 3 years prior. I was not a photographer then and still don’t really consider myself a “photographer” to this day.</p>

<p>My goal in this article is to walk you through my thought process to show you how I ended up investing my time and energy in an α6000… and why you should as well.</p>

<p>Note: This is a blog post targeted toward people investing in their first camera. If you’ve put significant money in another system, keep on doing you (but make the mirrorless jump anyway!).</p>

<p>To start, let’s go over the basics.</p>

<p>What’s a DSLR?</p>

<p>What do you think when someone mentions “DSLR”? In my experience, DSLR is used synonymously with “higher quality camera that has a cool-looking lens in front.” I’m just going to tell you outright that with a 99.9% chance, any Sony camera you encounter in the wild is not a DSLR.</p>

<p>Technically, any camera in the Sony α line is not a DSLR since DSLR stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex. The “reflex” is the important part, as all DSLR cameras have a mirror inside the body. Light comes in through the camera lens, bounces off the mirror, and shoots through the viewfinder in the top and into your eye. When you fully press down the shutter button of a DSLR, the mirror flips up to allow the light coming through the lens to hit a sensor: this is the photo you eventually see.</p>

<p>There are a couple of inherent drawbacks to any DSLR. The first one is that your viewfinder may show a different scene than what eventually is captured on your SD card since your viewfinder is typically optical (it’s just raw light coming from the lens and bouncing through a mirror or a prism), and the sensor that stores the image is inherently electronic. For higher-end cameras, this difference is negligible but for beginner cameras, this disparity can be large as noise, shutter speed, framing, and focus are affected by the electronic component.</p>

<p>The second one is that DSLRs are typically big. The bulky, bulbous look of Canon and Nikon cameras is due to the mirror element that adds additional heft and distance between the end of the camera lens and the sensor.</p>
