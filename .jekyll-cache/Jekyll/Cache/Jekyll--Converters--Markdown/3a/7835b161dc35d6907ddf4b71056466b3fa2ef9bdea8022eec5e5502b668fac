I"á<p>This is going to be a short post. I recently did a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-do-the-30-day-song-challenge-on-instagram-22774509">30-day music challenge</a> on my <a href="https://facebook.com/calebaren">Facebook</a>/<a href="https://instagram.com/calebaren">Instagram</a> stories. I‚Äôve never posted this extensively to my stories on any social media platform and I left the experience feeling very accomplished. I also got a lot of feedback about my music choice. All the feedback makes me feel a lot of feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve compiled a list of all 30 (actually 32, since I included a couple of extra pieces some days) pieces that I featured below:</p>

<h3 id="a-song-you-like-with-a-color-in-the-title">A song you like with a color in the title</h3>
