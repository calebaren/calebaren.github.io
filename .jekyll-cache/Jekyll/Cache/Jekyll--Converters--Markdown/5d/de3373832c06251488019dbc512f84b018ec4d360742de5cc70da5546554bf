I"<p>The world of <em>The Odyssey</em> is steeped in alcohol: at every meal, there is the expectation of watered-down wine to be served and a toast to the gods to be made. However, Homer’s peculiar use of wine on the island of the Cyclops belies a simple interpretation of wine as a means to inebriation, but as a symbol of gift-giving and graciousness. To this end, Homer employs wine as a physical talisman of the Greek custom of guest-friendship, or <em>xenia</em>. On the island of the Cyclops, Odysseus recounts two different types of wine from two different sources: one from Ismaros and one from Maron. Homer’s seemingly ordinary inclusion of two different wines on the island of Polyphemus reveals the importance of the reciprocal nature of gift-giving in <em>The Odyssey</em>.</p>
