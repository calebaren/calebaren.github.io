I"Ø<p>About a year and change ago, I was in the market for a camera. The only photography I had done up until that point was on my trusty iPhone 6s from 3 years prior. I was not a photographer then and still don‚Äôt really consider myself a ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù to this day.</p>

<p>My goal in this article is to walk you through my thought process to show you how I ended up investing my time and energy in an Œ±6000‚Ä¶ and why you should as well.</p>

<p>Note: This is a blog post targeted toward people investing in their first camera. If you‚Äôve put significant money in another system, keep on doing you (but make the mirrorless jump anyway!).</p>

<p>To start, let‚Äôs go over the basics.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs a DSLR?</p>

<p>What do you think when someone mentions ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù? In my experience, DSLR is used synonymously with ‚Äúhigher quality camera that has a cool-looking lens in front.‚Äù I‚Äôm just going to tell you outright that with a 99.9% chance, any Sony camera you encounter in the wild is not a DSLR.</p>

<p>Technically, any camera in the Sony Œ± line is not a DSLR since DSLR stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex. The ‚Äúreflex‚Äù is the important part, as all DSLR cameras have a mirror inside the body. Light comes in through the camera lens, bounces off the mirror, and shoots through the viewfinder in the top and into your eye. When you fully press down the shutter button of a DSLR, the mirror flips up to allow the light coming through the lens to hit a sensor: this is the photo saved to your SD card. This flipping-up motion gives these cameras their distinctive shutter noise.</p>

<p>There are a couple of inherent drawbacks to any DSLR. The first one is that your viewfinder may show a different scene than what eventually is captured on your SD card since your viewfinder is typically optical (it‚Äôs just raw light coming from the lens and bouncing through a mirror or a prism), and the sensor that stores the image is inherently electronic. For higher-end cameras, this difference is negligible but for beginner cameras, this disparity can be large as noise, shutter speed, framing, and focus are affected by the electronic component.</p>

<p>The second one is that DSLRs are typically big. The bulky, bulbous look of Canon and Nikon cameras is due to the mirror element that adds additional heft and distance between the end of the camera lens and the sensor. Other than requiring a significantly larger body to house the mirror system, this distance (also known as the flange focal distance) limits what kind of lenses you can use on a DSLR, which we‚Äôll get to in a second.</p>

<p>There are of course, many advantages to any DSLR camera and also more disadvantages, but for now, just remember these 2 things: DSLRs have mirrors that flip up, and this mirror takes up space.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs a MILC?</p>

<p>A Sony camera is not a DSLR. Sony cameras are Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras, or MILCs. As the name implies, MILCs don‚Äôt have a mirror. This has 3 important consequences:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The mirror is used in a DSLR to reflect light into the viewfinder. In MILCs, this is replaced by an electronic viewfinder, or EVF that is essentially taking a live fed of whatever your image sensor sees.
  
  
Because the image sensor can ‚Äúsee‚Äù the light at all times (in DSLRs, this is covered by the camera), image processing can be done prior to depressing the shutter. This reflects a WYSIWYG paradigm that addresses the ‚Äúmore or less‚Äù limitation of DSLRs.
  
  
The lack of mirror element means you can place the back of the lens right up against the image sensor, minimizing the depth of your camera body.
