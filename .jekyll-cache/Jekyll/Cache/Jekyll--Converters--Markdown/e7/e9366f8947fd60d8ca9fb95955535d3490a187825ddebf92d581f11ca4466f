I"‡<p>About a year and change ago, I was in the market for a new camera. The only photography I had done up until that point was on my trusty iPhone 6s from 3 years prior.</p>

<p>I had no idea what to look for in a camera, just that the Canons looked cool, the Nikons looked cool, and Fuji was also a kind of apple.</p>

<p>But this essentially characterized my perspective of the DSLR market; dominated by CanNikon with the other ‚Äúperiphery‚Äù brands falling by the wayside.</p>
