## About

Caleb is a third-year Harvard College student concentrating in statistics and computer science. Originally from Seattle, he abandoned the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest for the much milder weather of Boston, Massachusetts. As a college student and data scientist, he enjoys exploring data as they apply to all aspects to our lives--from analyzing customer behavior to gaining deeper insights into global environmental trends.

Beyond data science, Caleb wears many hats as team organizer, product manager, musician, and software developer. As the current President and past Director of Technology of the [Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations](https://hauscr.org), Caleb oversees a trans-Pacific team to offer 4 international conferences to over 1500 students. Additionally, Caleb is highly-demanded within the Harvard classical music community as a collaborative pianist and conductor, performing in multiple musical and recital engagements a semester.

For fun, Caleb tries to spend as much time with family as possible, extol the virtues of mirrorless cameras to anyone who will listen, read up on dimension reduction techniques, defend the merits of Seattle, hike, and lift things and set them down. 

<small>Oh, and he makes a mean mac and cheese.</small>
