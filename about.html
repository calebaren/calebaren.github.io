## About

I graduated from Harvard College with a degree in statistics and computer science in 2021. Originally from Seattle, I abandoned the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest and the blizzards of Boston for the much milder climate of San Francisco.

As a product manager, I have extensive experience working cross-functionally with engineers, designers, sales teams, end-users, and C-suite stakeholders. I am currently a Product Manager at [IXL Learning](https://www.ixl.com), working on the IXL Quizzes team to create delightful products for millions of teachers, students, and administrators across the globe. I was also selected as a 2021 [Schwarzman Scholar](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/scholars/?y=2021%7C2022#caleb-ren).
<!-- As the President and Director of Technology of the [Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations](https://hauscr.org), Caleb oversaw a trans-Pacific team to offer 4 international conferences to over 1500 students. As a research specialist with [Vocal Justice](https://www.vocaljustice.org/), an early-stage education non-profit, Caleb conducted interviews with high-school principals to analyze demand for innovative, justice-based education programming. -->
For fun, I volunteer for [Code Tenderloin](https://www.codetenderloin.org/), nerd out over statistics, extol the virtues of mirrorless cameras to anyone who will listen, and try to spend as much time with friends and family as possible.
