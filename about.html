## About

Caleb Ren graduated from Harvard College with a degree in statistics and computer science in 2021. Originally from Seattle, he abandoned the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest for the much milder weather of Boston. 

Caleb has wide-ranging experience working in education technology, social justice, product managment, and software. As the President and Director of Technology of the [Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations](https://hauscr.org), Caleb oversaw a trans-Pacific team to offer 4 international conferences to over 1500 students. As a research specialist with [Vocal Justice](https://www.vocaljustice.org/), an early-stage education non-profit, Caleb conducted interviews with high-school principals to analyze demand for innovative, justice-based education programming.

For fun, Caleb tries to spend as much time with family as possible, extol the virtues of mirrorless cameras to anyone who will listen, read up on dimension reduction techniques, defend the merits of Seattle, hike, and lift things and set them down.
