## About

Caleb is a current Schwarzman Scholar and Harvard graduate (statistics and computer science). Originally from Seattle, he abandoned the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest for the much milder weather of Boston. He enjoys exploring data as they apply to all aspects to our lives--from analyzing customer behavior to gaining deeper insights into global environmental trends.

Beyond data science, Caleb has wide-ranging experience working in fields as diverse as social justice and product management. As the President and Director of Technology of the [Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations](https://hauscr.org), Caleb oversaw a trans-Pacific team to offer 4 international conferences to over 1500 students. As a research specialist with [Vocal Justice](https://www.vocaljustice.org/), an early-stage education non-profit, Caleb conducted interviews with high-school principals to analyze demand for innovative, justice-based education programming. Additionally, Caleb is an active collaborative musician, performing in multiple musical and recital engagements throughout the Seattle and Boston communities.

For fun, Caleb tries to spend as much time with family as possible, extol the virtues of mirrorless cameras to anyone who will listen, read up on dimension reduction techniques, defend the merits of Seattle, hike, and lift things and set them down.
