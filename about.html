## About

Caleb Ren graduated from Harvard College with a degree in statistics and computer science in 2021. Originally from Seattle, he abandoned the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest and the blizzards of Boston for the much milder climate of San Francisco.

Caleb has wide-ranging experience working in education technology, social justice, product managment, and software. He is currently an Associate Product Manager at IXL Learning, working on the Teacher Experience and Rosetta Stone teams to create delightful products for teachers and learners across the globe. Caleb was also selected as a 2021 Schwarzman Scholar from a competitive application process.
<!-- As the President and Director of Technology of the [Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations](https://hauscr.org), Caleb oversaw a trans-Pacific team to offer 4 international conferences to over 1500 students. As a research specialist with [Vocal Justice](https://www.vocaljustice.org/), an early-stage education non-profit, Caleb conducted interviews with high-school principals to analyze demand for innovative, justice-based education programming. -->
For fun, Caleb volunteers for Code Tenderloin, nerds out over statistics, extols the virtues of mirrorless cameras to anyone who will listen, and tries to spend as much time with friends and family as possible.
